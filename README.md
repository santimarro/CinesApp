# CinesApp
A simple app that shows you the schedules of the current movies in Cordoba Argentina.

State:
  1. Currently working in a static way. It shows you static information, not the actual one. This will change in the next days.
  2. UX: Simple, just to show the idea and how it works, to be implemented with actual designers.
  3. Bugs: Main activity shows a visual bug, all movies appear with giant white gaps below them. To be fixed in the next days.
